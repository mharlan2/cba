## #OnceYouPopYouCantStop
#### Workshop

<span class="textcolor">2018 — Complete</span>

Collaborators: University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee

"This workshop explores how to animate architectural ideas while augmenting audience participation. It aims to develop new forms of performative analog representation that amplify architectural character and articulate an emphatic tone of voice. 

Distinct from the temporal use of the term pop-up to describe temporary retail or exhibitions, this workshop explores the material possibilities of pop-up as it relates to children’s picture books that transform two-dimensional illustrations into three-dimensional cutouts, often by pulling a paper tab. While commonly regarded as a frivolous special effect for children, we believe that the mechanical possibilities of physically transforming visual fragments from two- to three-dimensions provide serious communicative potential for architectural representation in general, and for expanding audience participation in architectural storytelling specifically. If all architectural representation engages a liminal state in two-and-half-dimensions where three dimensional ideas are projected upon a two-dimensional picture plane, then pop-up optics makes this default condition physically palpable and heightens the theatrical performance of representation in the process."
