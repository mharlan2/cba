## Handely Deck
#### Residential Deck / Architectural Design

<span class="textcolor">2018 â€” In Progress</span>

Architectural Design

This new exterior deck, staircase, and tube slide animates the side elevation of an existing residential home with access and play. The construction is concieved as a friendly creature with a sqiuggly tail that is rubbing shoulders with the existing building. Angled ballustrade panels echo the siding of the home and emphasize the angular form of the staircase.
