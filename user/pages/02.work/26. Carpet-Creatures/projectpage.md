## Carpet Creatures
#### Installation in closed public school

<span class="textcolor">2018 â€” In Progress</span>

Exhibit and Installation Design

Collaborators: Ladi Famodu, Darrell McKinney, Borderless Studio

Carpet Creatures positions vibrant carpet tiles and concrete cylinders within a classroom in Overton Elementary school to recast the room as an inhabitable gameboard, a field of play, and a platform for conjuring memories and scheming the future. The carpet tiles and concrete cylinders strike lines, suggest grids, and imply zones that offer an organizational framework for the community to congregate and assume temporary ownership. As a game with no set rules, a playing field with no out-of-bounds, the classroom becomes a color-infused arena for playful occupation and conversation. Neighbors are invited to bring their own chairs and position them within and around the intervention as desired.

This project is part of Creative Grounds, an initiative led by Borderless Studio to explore the community and urban role of school grounds after the largest public schools closure in Chicago's history.
