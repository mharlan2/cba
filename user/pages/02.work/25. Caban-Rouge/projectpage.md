<span class="textcolor">2018 â€” In Progress</span>

Architectural Design, Exhibit and Installation Design

The sukkah is inspired by the bold color, warmth, and fertility of pomegranates, featuring an array of eighteen fresh pomegranates that adorn its open-air ceiling. Main entry to the sukkah welcomes visitors to pop their head under its outstretched walls, inviting playful engagement and immersion inside its perforated enclosure.
