## Twisted Hippo
#### Taproom and eatery interior

<span class="textcolor">2018 â€” Under Construction</span>

Architectural Design, Signage Design, Environmental Graphics, Construction Administration

This exterior signage and interior design for Twisted Hippo Brewing creates a radical new identity for a existing taproom space. The design differentiates the existing loud and open interior into a series of more intimate "little worlds" that create small zones of specific seating, activity, and character. Bubbly wall and floor graphics articulate the 'Carbonated Cafe' up front; custom tables, planters, and scrim position the 'Communal Core' in the middle; and a custom-fabricated suspended felt cloud canopy shelters an intimate banquette and perfromance platform in the rear.
