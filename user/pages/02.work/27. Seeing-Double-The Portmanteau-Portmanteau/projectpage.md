## Seeing Double: The Portmanteau Portmanteau
#### Architectural playthings

<span class="textcolor">2018 — In Progress</span>

Exhibit and Installation Design

The Portmanteau Portmanteau is a game for packing multiple architectural identities into one brimming suitcase. Just as a linguistic portmanteau seamlessly blends two existing words into a new combined word, this series of architectural portmanteaux are physical models that seamlessly blend two nuggets of architectural identity into a single object. For example, study a stindow (stair + window), ponder a porridor (porch + corridor), or woolgather over a woof (wall + roof). More than an exhibit piece, The Portmanteau Portmanteau is a set of architectural playthings to engage audiences of all ages and expand the architectural imagination. Each model condenses multiple architectural meanings, behaviors, aesthetics, and characters into a singular toy-like interactive object. In turn, each portmanteau may be combined with other portmanteaux to form fantastic compound “sentences” within the dioramic interior of the suitcase.
