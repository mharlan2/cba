## Grocery Futures
#### Core Studio

<span class="textcolor">2018 — Ongoing</span>

Collaborators: Illinois Institute of Technology

"This studio will consider the architectural future of the American grocery store during a cultural moment in which contemporary customers demand fresher food, more local options in opposition to food deserts, a better in-store “experience,” and expanded delivery or pickup options.

The grocery store is perhaps the ultimate American public space. Unlike institutions that put “public” in their namesake (e.g. the public library) and distinct from other commercial businesses, the grocery store uniquely provides a commodity that everyone needs—the basic edible provisions for life. For this reason, everyone goes to the grocery store, rendering the grocery store as a space where people are most likely to encounter the Other—people different from themselves. As opposed to high-end or discount grocers that cater to specific ends of the economic spectrum, the middle-market grocery store seeks to stock something for everyone. It is a space of radical inclusion, peddling an array of tastes and a comprehensive inventory of provisions. While different cultural and demographic groups occupying the same grocery store may or may not interact directly, this studio believes that there is cultural value in providing a shared space for different bodies to co-occupy while meeting their basic needs. Two people who speak different languages reaching for the same vegetable in the produce section may just provide an entry point for reconnecting a polarized populace and cultivating a civic commons in a new aisle-crossing venue (pun intended)."
