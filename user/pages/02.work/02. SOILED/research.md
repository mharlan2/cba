## SOILED
#### Architectural Periodical

<span class="textcolor">2018 â€” Ongoing</span>

Collaborators: Matthew Harlan, Hollen Reischer

SOILED is a periodical of architectural stories that makes a mess of the politics of space. Positioned between a literary journal and design magazine, SOILED narrates a playfully sincere and seriously humorous exploration of oft-overlooked dimensions of our built environment. We believe that by intensifying the fictive and storytelling potential in architecture, we might engage a broader public in architectural ideas from discourse to action.
