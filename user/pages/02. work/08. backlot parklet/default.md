# Backlot Parklet
## Sidewalk public space

These parklets extend a local coffee shop into the public way and envision alternative ways to inhabit a parallel parking space along a commercial thoroughfare. Each proposal engages a dialogue between the coffee shop and the public park across the street. An exploration of scale produces a character that is both at home in the urban environment and welcoming to passersby. The graphic use of familiar architectural figures frames relationships between inside and outside, near and far, and public and private. Additionally, the adoption of specific park references (the bench, the pavilion, and the lawn) transports the image of the public park into the no-man’s-land of a former parking space.
